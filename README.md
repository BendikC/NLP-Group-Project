# NLP-Group-Project

Setting up the project:

1. Download the data files and put them into the data/ directory, can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIZcNcU2wtiJNr3BUyX2GIUtnHEfbQDi?usp=sharing

2. Make a virtualenv with conda, using ```
conda env create -f environment.yml
``` to install the required dependencies (make sure to add/remove dependencies while we work, as we most likely will need to use more dependencies)
